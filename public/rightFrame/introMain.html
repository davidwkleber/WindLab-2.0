		<p> This interface will guide you through a series of experiments in the field of wind energy and wind turbine technology.
			Please use the arrows to the left and right to navigate from one experiment to the other. 
			The experiments are grouped in chapters. Use the chapter navigation on top to jump to a specific chapter. </p>
		<p> On the left part of the window, you find the control panel of the WindLab. The gauges display the actual measured speed of rotation 
			of the rotor, the voltage and current of the generator and its power (product of voltage and current). </p>
		<p> Below the gauges is the control of wind speed, pitch angle and current sink, as further described on the following pages. </p>
